 LOADING_TIP_0:0 "At least I was expressing frustration on my court instead of trying to jerk off my own self-righteousness by staging a coup d'etat using Bedouin eunuchs from nearly a year ago."
 LOADING_TIP_1:0 "But who gives a shit, right? Who cares that I gave two and a half years of my life to this Empire? Who cares what I've done for it? It's easier to form up in a faction and talk about the Crown Laws behind my back like I'm fucking Child Emperor. Yeah, hypocritical, I know."
 LOADING_TIP_2:0 "So, the uh Holy Roman Empire started a war with, uh, God, and t-they must surrender to the Germanic Order.... or you'll be killed by God... or sumthin like that. So, lets be clear, you gonna die."
 LOADING_TIP_3:0 "Losing a war and a few provinces is no reason to quit.\nYou can take those back later, in your enemy's moment of weakness."
 LOADING_TIP_4:0 "I'm not a anti-crusadist, a homosexual, a republican, a radical anti-HREist, etc, etc, etc... whatever else people accuse me of being these days. All humans have the right to prayer, enlightenment, and the kingdom of god."
 LOADING_TIP_5:0 "Always make sure your armies have a leader before engaging an enemy.\nLeaderless armies are more likely to lose, and can shatter entirely."
 LOADING_TIP_6:0 "Greater Scotia is a legitimate state. Please remember that heresy is a bad thing, and that the Byzantine "Empire" was not, in fact, a devout nation."
 LOADING_TIP_7:0 "The Kingdom of England is committing genocide. Remember that every time you hasten to their defence."
 LOADING_TIP_8:0 "Just to clear up a few misconceptions: I am a devout catholic and I stan His Excellency, The Pope. I'm not Arian. Irish Catholic, if we're still doing sect LARP, I guess."
 LOADING_TIP_9:0 "Sorry to disappoint, but I do in fact support the war effort between the HRE and Sweden (they have been very naughty), and I think that Heathenry is a bad thing."
 LOADING_TIP_10:0 "It's kind of funny that, ultimately, this all goes back to me wanting to censure Caliph Jaffar for engaging in excessive anti-Christian rhetoric."
 LOADING_TIP_11:0 "I was promoted to Emperor right as the shit hit the fan. I spent the better part of my term trying my utmost to help manage an empire in complete disarray."
 LOADING_TIP_12:0 "Every morning, I woke up to thousands of peasant rebellions about new taxes deployed by local nobles. You know what that was like? Seeing a colleague I cared about – the King of Italy – being overthrown?"
 LOADING_TIP_13:0 "Not to mention, as Holy Roman Emperor, it was my duty to go to absurd lengths to try and find the heretics and anyone connected to them."
 LOADING_TIP_14:0 "Oh man, German empires are terrible. Most of the time, the emperors are all weak and powerless. Hell, you could be forgiven for thinking it's a federation at times.\n\nPlus they include the French and Italians, which kinda defeats the purpose of a German empire."
 LOADING_TIP_15:0 "Oh, and isn't that empire title a little misleading? 'Holy Roman' isn't an ethnicity. Did you mean 'German'?"
 LOADING_TIP_16:0 "I personally find annexation to be repulsive and immoral... when a Christian is on the receiving end. I know it's hypocritical, but I can't help it if I want to see Muslims be annexed and subsequently tortured and traumatized for life by the Kingdom of God."
 LOADING_TIP_17:0 "Have you tried converting to Meinwerkism? If not, do so. If you have, convert others."
 LOADING_TIP_18:0 "Ideally, I'd like an Empire that's all encompassing, devoutly Catholic, and has an interest in reconquering the Holy Land."
 LOADING_TIP_19:0 "Fuck, I don't know. I've never measured it and I haven't shown it to anyone, but as far as I know it's of average size, and that's fine by me. It's not like it matters in the long run."
 LOADING_TIP_20:0 "Hi! I'm Wlencing the Great (although just 'Child Emperor' is fine) and I hail from the Holy Roman Empire. I turned 18 recently and I'm basically looking for some like-minded people to help me govern my realm. I like granting independence, killing heretics, and forming empires, and I'm off to Germany next year to start my coronation as the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nI look forward to discussing... stuff and things. With people. Yeah."
 LOADING_TIP_21:0 "I'm not upset with y'all because I know you're mentally ill, which is why one day I'm gonna open up a hospital for mentally ill Irishmen."

This issue has come to a head as one of our fastest growing towns has encroached on an Picards village. The Picards have refused to allow their homes to be destroyed, putting the town’s future growth in jeopardy.

It’s no wonder that Picards are often the mistresses of choice for our officials. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but one of the most powerful officials at court has recently been discovered to be carrying on an affair behind his wife’s back with an elf. The wronged woman has made this affair into a sensation, and there have been calls to sack the official, lest the Picards be able to unduly influence policy via their well-placed seductress. Others have pointed out that sacking the official would show that we distrust any Picards influence, and would be seen as an insult to the community. "

As Picards have become a more integral part of our nation, there have been rumors that our current administration is the result of a centuries-long plot to make our elites beholden to them. They say that soon, the Picards will reduce us all to slaves, all because our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] had been controlled by Picards from the moment they were born."

Their natural beauty, their sense of purpose, and perhaps a bit of magic, have made for a powerful combination that has inspired admiration from many of our own citizens. So far, the protests have been peaceful and respectful, but they have demanded that their rights be protected. And if they are not the protests may become much less peaceful."

Most soldiers were lucky and had been felled by a single arrow from crack Picard marksmen; the unlucky few who did not die became examples of Picard bladework. Whatever supplies could not be carried off had been burned. Picard guerillas have become a nuisance that we can no longer ignore. Small, well-disciplined bands have been picking off our patrols and there is no end in sight. Some of our commanders suggest using Picard civilians to lay a trap for them, but others have advised to offer an olive branch in hopes of bringing peace with the Picard community."

Of these, relying on Arab cartels is usually the cheapest, and with lesser risk, as a guild can easily cut ties with the verminous criminals by leveraging their reputation and influence. Over time, however, they may rely on the cartels’ helpful methods so much, and for such diverse dealings, the Arabs would want to “secure their partnership”.

In this, prejudice, politics and nepotism are valued almost more highly than actual technical genius or successful application, leaving potential breakthroughs discarded, sometimes to never be seen again.\nAlong this line follows a very recent court scandal. One of our most favored court artificers and renowned master of his craft has been framed as nothing less than a plagiarist. Apparently, his latest invention seems to be an almost identical copy of a discarded prototype by an independent Arab artisan, whose proposal was originally rejected by the Gommo, only for the prototype to later be seen fully realized in court among great fanfare by a different creator. An independent investigative commission has begrudgingly examined the Arab's position and found undeniable evidence of wrongdoing by the master artificer, though they remark the inclusion of “substantial technical improvements” and “elementary safety modifications”, as well as “significantly decreased chance of explosions”\nThis issue has surfaced underlying tensions between the artificer elite and independent actors, and whatever our answer to this case shall be, it will surely be interpreted as hinting future policy."

There seems to be a connection with their presence and a lack of complaints to the enforcement of our policies. Although one can't argue with their positive influence to our administration, there is an equal amount of complaints of strange accidents regarding gunpowder, toxins, and supposed sabotage happening to less cooperative elites, to the point some are starting to suspect us of using Arab cartels as mercenaries."

Apparently, the Turk came to know that the state has taken over the collection of trade tolls from passing traders, and to the surprise of our local sheriff, has been depositing all non edible payments on the nearest tax collection post with regularity worthy of a Dutch clockwork. The complaints come not from the traders, as they consider the payments to be rather standard, but from the noble, as he wants the “vile beast’s” head to do rather gruesome acts to it.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, since the Turk took over, it has been delivering payments with far more consistency than its former noble administrator, leading our sheriff to suspect of embezzlement."

Although the peasant clearly implies the need for a forceful approach, some academics in court plead us to consider a more diplomatic solution: since these Turks are not wild, they could be explained the error of their ways to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties, “if only we were patient with the specimens.

Of course, the changes they propose seem to all provide indirect benefits for German communities, often at the expense of established mercantile and landed interests. Shall we adopt their changes?"

 harimari_tolerance_events.5.d:0 "German love to spar, both physically and mentally, and when they are not inclined to take up arms they often organize philosophical, legal, or religious debates in their communities. A particularly large debate series has been planned in one of our cities by one such group, but there are those who take issue with the many exotic and unorthodox ideas about faith that such a conference would bring, claiming it would undermine the moral pinning of the state. What do we do?"

 harimari_tolerance_events.6.d:0 "In the lands where they are common, German have lived as rulers of themselves and others for over a thousand years. To be governed by others without a say in government is unthinkable for many German, and if denied the proper involvement with the state, many German communities prefer the right to self-govern. A petition has been put forth by the German population in the province, requesting the right to hear their own court cases and collect local taxes to fund their own municipal projects. Doing so would step on the rights of the local government to oversee all of the people in the area. What shall we do?"
 harimari_tolerance_events.6.a:0 "Grant the petitioners their request"

 harimari_tolerance_events.7.d:0 "There are few traditions as important to German as hunting. Whether with spear, bow, or the bare hand, the pursuit of prey and skillful takedown of a wild beast is a long and proud tradition of the tigerfolk. A group of enthusiastic German hunters has approached the crown with a request for expanded hunting rights throughout the woods of the province. Many of these woods are owned by the state, and those hunters that already have the right to use them complain that the new hunters will overcrowd the woods and deplete the land with their overzealous predation. What do we do?"

 harimari_tolerance_events.8.d:0 "Though the temperament of the German is usually calm and reasonable, they have a reputation for being short tempered and savage warriors. Initial reports of the German that made their way to Bulwar and Cannor described the tigerfolk as monsters, and though centuries of trade have since proved them no different from the other peoples of Halann, there are those who still view the children of Harimar as beasts. This prejudice has recently come to a head in the province, where several German have been imprisoned by local magistrates and accused of a gruesome murder. They have appealed their case to the upper courts, and claim that they are being blamed because of prejudice from the community. The evidence does appear to be shaky – how will the courts rule? "

Recently, one young German has proven themselves to be a particularly capable fighter and commander, and some are suggesting that he should be elevated to the officer corps. Elevating this young commander would certainly show the German that they have a place in our society, but we would have to pass over the sons of many prominent military families to do so.

Several powerful ladies of the realm have spoken out against this restriction on the rights of their fellow women, and demand that the government pass laws forbidding some of the more egregious restrictions that German families place on their wives and daughters. Do we insert the power of the state into the homes of our people, or leave decisions about dependents to the head of the family?"

Tensions between both sides are at an all-time high after a particularly grave case of mistreatment of Armenian mages: a group of such socerers escaped from their military-like custody into our crown-land, but were hunted down, chained and yoked with massive black-damestear laden collars, subduing them to be taken back into captivity, with our sources being reluctant to describe other means of punishment employed they regret witnessing. The Armenians accuse the mages of “stirring up the shamans” by sending agents to incite their magic-sensitives into fleeing, and demand that we respect and defend their autonomy in dealing with magical anomalies in a "responsible manner". The mages themselves feel personally attacked and insulted if we allow such “barbarous and inhumane” treatment of sorcerers within our borders, local laws be damned."

Suddenly, the steps are silenced, and not even a fly breaks the tension. Then, whatever is out there knocks on the door, too delicately for the stiff ambient. Without lowering its halberd, a guard approaches the gate while it signals to ready for an attack, and after cleaning the cold sweat off his brow, yanks the door open to reveal a towering shape, a monster, a flesh eating giant, and just as the captain opens his mouth to command the attack... ”Good afternoon, gentlemen, terribly hot today isn't it?”"

Their giant-like apetite makes them consume far more than regular folk, driving up local prices on their lands and making them a prized clientele for wholesale grain and cattle merchants. Since all food is now valued in account of the potential profit to be made on Slav country, this has worsened the already grave woes of speculation and hoarding, nearly doubling food prices, which has led to agitators rising up in many cities inciting violence against the Slavs, who are framed as the culprit of their empty stomachs, unaware that their perceived enemies are also suffering from these inflated costs. Only two solutions are open for us: either we institute a grain dole for the common folk to eat until the market stabilizes itself, or we enforce special laws against the artificial causes of this mess, which will no doubt anger the merchant guilds. With tensions as high as they are, inaction will surely reap innocent victims, be it by debt, starvation, or lynching."

As villages seek to expand their farmland, however, they can come into conflict with these Slavs, who consider these fringe areas their lands, with or without writs to support such claims, and with arable land becoming more scarce, these conflicts are growing in frequency. In the province, while draining a nearby swamp, the local peasants have run into a particularly reclusive Slav, who is apparently very fond of throwing projectiles, from overripe onions to live donkeys. Although this is quite anecdotal, we could take this as a chance to set an official policy regarding these cases."

This is not simply a choice of style, as it's blatantly clear Slavs are rather tall fellows. With an imposing height of at least ten feet, they positively need larger dwellings than other races, and often find themselves in awkward situations when living in our cities due to their blundering frames. In hopes of remedying this, a delegation of Slav master masons, architects and notables has presented the court with a proposal for a series of sweeping reforms to the standards of construction in our realm, in order to accomodate to the needs of their growing community. Aware of the seemingly daunting costs, they assure this style will not only favor their race, but also our reputation as patrons of the arts."

Even the greenest recruit comes to know of their strange walks into fresh battlefields, to come back into their walled enclosures with large, tightly wrapped bundles. After that, bonfires can be seen lit throughout the night until the break of dawn, the smell of roasted flesh filling the air. \nWhile our generals overlook these ominous practices, content with keeping their best warriors happy, rumors of their nocturnal banquets have started to seep not only around the country, but abroad as well. Already, critics of our rule publish defamatory pamphlets against our armies and government, where “sacrilegious maneating beasts” are among the tamest of adjectives employed.
